- objects that contain the date and the price

- sort by price 
- then go through each item and 
- once sorted look


the lowest value is 15.28
the highest value is 27.39

15.28 occurs on day 15

27.39 occurs on day 21

15(15.28), 21(27.39) - solution for first data sorted

------------------


15.61 occurs on day 30 - therefore can't use it
15.79 occurs on day 


27.2 occurs on day
